<p>The main producing area Silver Vine is Asia, which distributes in Northeast, Northwest and Southwest China. The average altitude is about 500 meters. It climbs along rocks and lives in the jungle. Because of the different temperature and humidity in different areas, the concentration ratio of tenuifolide in Silver Vine has different effects. Silver Vine in Northeast China has a long growth cycle due to cold weather, relatively strong odor and long residue time, which is conducive to storage. Asia Silver Vine blooms in May, and is picked from September to October. The fruit is generally picked before the fruit turns yellow, which helps to keep the integration of spice and sugar, and is not easy to be too sweet.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most cats live indoors. Cats raised indoors are more likely to become bored and depressed than cats freely scattered outside, so indoor environment determines their quality of life. When cats are alone, they need better environmental characteristics to improve their quality of life, such as vertical space. Configuration, hiding place, itchy disposition, playing and chasing opportunities, etc. Lack of free outdoor cat or lack of indoor environment disposition will lead to some problems in cat behavior: aggressive, destructive behavior and lower urinary tract diseases, together with today's dietary ratios and nutritional supplements, more and more. Obesity, anorexia or loss of appetite in cats can endanger their health. Although the cat's living environment is constantly improving, the American Cat Doctors Association recognizes the importance of environmental odor to cats, but it is a problem often overlooked by cat-raising groups. Odor stimulation is an environmental theme that cats cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>We all know that cats have a sensitive sense of smell and respond positively to certain odors, such as cat mint, which is a herb that allows most cats to react quickly. According to the American Cat Doctors Association, 68% of cats responded to cat mint and almost 75% of cats responded to Silver Vine. Scientific data show that Silver Vine contains a relatively high concentration of tenuifolide. How to stimulate the cat's sense of smell to give indoor cats a good living environment, silverveine cat toys is a good choice. The dried gall fruit and Silver Vine powder are the most popular among domestic cats. Asia Silver Vine seems to be a good alternative to cat mint for domestic cats that do not respond to cat mint.</p>
