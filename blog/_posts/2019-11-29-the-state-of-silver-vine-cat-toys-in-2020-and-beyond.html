<p>• High purity, no fake ingredients!! Well, this is very important because people made black money here! Especially the series of pressed products and the leaves in silver vine powder. I know it is difficult to distinguish how many impurities there are. And this part is often the gray area where bad businesses seek huge profits. Low-end impurities are easy to be mixed into the products. In contrast ,in addition to using natural glutinous rice juice for bonding, ASIASILVERVINE do not add any other invalid powder to lower down the cost. From the source to ensure that cats can enjoy this gift from nature.This is also the “Wild Nature” tendency 2020 & beyond.</p>

<p>• Products are diversified, combined with cats’ favorite feathers, and have a variety of interesting shapes.</p>
<p>We know feather is the cat’s favorite! This combination provides the cat with multiple satisfactions. If they temporarily tired of the silver vine you give it, The feathers can offer cats more comforts. What’s more, our designers and product engineers have designed different fabric shapes for cats, such as dragonflies, butterflies, frogs, and even owls, which will become "prey" for cats, making our cats feel like returning to nature without leaving home. This is what we often say, let the cats return to the nature and release their natural instinct!</p>
<p>• Sustainable utilization of resources and environmental protection.</p>
<p>As a responsible brand, ASIASILVERVINE only took the redundant parts of the silver vine trees to carry out resource utilization and product development without damaging the ecological environment. Although our strength is very limited, together with the strength from you and every global consumer who cares about the ecological environment of the earth, we believe we can create a sustainable and long-term future for cats.</p>
