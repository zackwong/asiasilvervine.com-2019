<p>Everyone who have a cat at home must know a truth, that cats are different with dogs. Dogs can play with a dog toy for one whole afternoon if you do not take it away, but cat does not. You need to serve your cat, like the honest and loyal servant you ever seen in the history.</p>
<p>Even so, you will desperately find that your cat does not often like the toys given to her, or her interest does not last long at all. Usually those toys were designed nicely with beautiful or funny shapes people like and think cat would like, too. But sadly, the answer is negative.</p>
<p>What attract cats attention most is not a beautiful or funny shape, not a mouse or a bird, or a snake like you read in the legend stories… It is a flavor, sending out from the Silvervine, a plant wildly grow in mountainous areas of North-East China, AND, with high altitude and wild growth environment you never need to worry about the pesticide residue like a labor planted catnip grass, although those sellers claim they are safe. Look at the picture we taken from the mountain, is there any concern of pesticide? No, of course not.</p>
